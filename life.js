//
// The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two  dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, 
// each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight 
// neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
// 
// At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
// 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
// 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
// 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
// 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
//
// The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the 
// above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the 
// discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a 
// pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
